    <h1>Veganism</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Definition:</h2>
        <p>Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an
            associated
            philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.[b] A follower of the diet or the philosophy is
            known as
            a vegan.[c] Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (also known as
            "strict vegetarians") refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived
            substances.[d] An ethical vegan (also known as a "moral vegetarian") is someone who not only follows a vegan
            diet but extends the philosophy into
            other areas of their lives, and opposes the use of animals for any purpose.[e] Another term is
            "environmental
            veganism", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial farming of
            animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.</p>
        <h2>Vegan etymology:</h2>
        <p>In August 1944, several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted
            to
            non-dairy
            vegetarianism. When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester branch, set up a
            new
            quarterly newsletter in November 1944, priced tuppence.[6] He called it The Vegan News. He chose the word
            vegan
            himself,
            based on "the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian'" because it marked, in Mr Watson's words,
            "the
            beginning
            and end of vegetarian".</p>
        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p>he practice can be traced to Indus Valley Civilization in 3300–1300 BCE in the Indian
            subcontinent,[49][50][51]
            particularly in northern and western ancient India.[52] Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such
            as
            Mahavira
            and Acharya Kundakunda, the Tamil poet Valluvar, the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka; Greek
            philosophers
            such as Empedocles, Theophrastus, Plutarch, Plotinus, and Porphyry; and the Roman poet Ovid and the
            playwright
            Seneca
            the Younger.[53][54] The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict
            vegetarianism,[55][56]
            but his
            life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all.[57] He
            almost
            certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans[57] and from wearing woolen garments.[57] Eudoxus of
            Cnidus, a
            student of Archytas and Plato, writes that "Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided
            killing
            and
            killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and
            hunters".[57]
            One of the
            earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al-Maʿarri (c. 973 – c. 1057).[a][58] Their arguments were based on
            health, the
            transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in De Abstinentia ab Esu
            Animalium
            ("On
            Abstinence from Animal Food", c. 268 – c. 270)—that if humans deserve justice, then so do animals.</p>
